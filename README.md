# Green Wheels - Frontend
Representational logic for Green Wheels Project.

The frontend is built with pure JavaScript and HTML, offering a lightweight and efficient client-side experience. It features a native routing system using URL hashes, allowing seamless navigation without requiring a server. The application employs an index HTML template, dynamically loading content based on the active route, which ensures a responsive and modular user interface. This approach provides a simple yet effective way to manage dynamic content while maintaining compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
